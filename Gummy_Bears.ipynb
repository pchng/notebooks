        "An approximate numerical solution can be easier to derive because it requires less understanding of probability theory. Furthermore, not all problems even have an analytical solution, but for those that do, the analytical solution is often more difficult to reason about.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. In Python, we can use `random.randrange(m)` to generate a number between $[0, m - 1]$ which represents a gummy bear flavor. Each of the $m$ values thus has an equal chance of being generated each time we call this method.\n",
        "2. We then do this $n$ times and store each value in a list, which then represents a single gummy bear package or _sample_. We can do this because we assumed that gummy bears were selected independently, i.e. the previous flavor selections do not affect the subsequent selections.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be done many times, after which we count the fraction of packages that had all flavors. The advantage of a numerical approximation like this is that it's relatively simple to understand, and doesn't require any special understanding of probability theory other than the assumption we've made that all flavors are equally probable."

We have to verify the code for correctness, but we don't really have to understand much probability theory or combinatorics. However, this solution only gives us an estimate. We can improve the accuracy of the estimation by running more simulations and taking more CPU time.\n",

We can then come up with an expression for the solution, which may still be quite involved! However, the overall calculation isn't as computationally complex as the simulation done for the numerical approximation, and will give us the _exact_ answer rather than an approximation. Furthermore, understanding the analytical solution may give you a deeper appreciation for the problem.\n",
